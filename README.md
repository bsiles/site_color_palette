# Site Color Palette Generator

**Purpose:**
This Python tool extracts and visualizes color palettes from any website, making it easy to analyze and hand off color schemes for design or development.

**Main Features
Extract Color Palettes from Websites:**
Given a website URL, the tool fetches the siteâ€™s CSS and HTML, analyzes them, and identifies the main colors used.

**Color Classification:**
The script classifies extracted colors into categories:
Primary
Secondary
Accent
Neutral
This helps in understanding the color hierarchy and usage on the site.

**Palette Auto-Optimization:**
The tool can automatically optimize the palette for better hand-off to designers or builders, ensuring the most relevant and visually distinct colors are selected.

**Visualization:**
Generates a visual preview of the color palette, displaying each color group in a clear, organized layout.
Includes interactive features like hover and active states for primary colors.
Can save the visualization as an image for sharing or documentation.

**Headless Functionality:**
The script can run in headless mode, making it suitable for automated workflows or CI/CD pipelines.
